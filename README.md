# Snake Game

## Introduction
Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer. The game features a game area with boundaries, keyboard controls for snake movement, and a scoring system.

## Features
- Control a snake using the arrow keys to eat food and grow longer.
- Game area with boundaries to prevent the snake from going off-screen.
- Randomly generated food for the snake to eat.
- Game over when the snake collides with the wall or itself.
- Restart and quit options after game over.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## How to Play
1. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
2. Eat the food to increase the snake's length.
3. Avoid colliding with the wall or the snake's own body.
4. Try to achieve the highest score possible.

## Development
The game is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game logic is implemented in the `script.js` file, which handles game initialization, snake movement, collision detection, and user input. The game interface is styled using the `style.css` file, and the game is displayed in the `index.html` file.

## Future Enhancements
- Difficulty levels with faster snake movement or larger game area.
- High score leaderboard to compare scores with other players.
- Sound effects and animations for a more immersive experience.
